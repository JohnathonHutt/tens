look into adding prettier support

Work on the actual game

Want to make it so that the piece takes gets the get - if piece is moved down manually clock is refreshed
- if time is greater than the levels piece time the piece is moved and the timeSinceMove is set to 0

// in the future maybe an map for key inputs that


todo practical

highlight with letter keys and explode with space bar!

piece doesn't move until after I lift up the key - should not be the case

how I store gameBoard date


Nice to haves:

projection downward - be able to toggle this on or off

grid lines

Needs:

timed handling of button hold downs


// Issues

trying to abstract key controls into controller class - worked but results in double firing of the event handler somehow
Not seeing this issue with just a function.


todo:

fix issues caused by timeGap refactor ---- done

add score and breaks logic --- done

refactor controller methods --- done

clean up score and breaks

make next piece viewer

brainstorm animation approaches

add end game logic --- mostly done

add animations
